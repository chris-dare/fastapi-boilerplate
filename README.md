# Core API for Oremi
This API is built on FastAPI

## Launching
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

This is code I'm writing for a school project. I thought it will be of public benefit so I'm writing the foundations of it and making it public. Once it reaches stability, I will make a private fork. 

** My Archilles heels is not documenting code until it runs. So bear with me.
